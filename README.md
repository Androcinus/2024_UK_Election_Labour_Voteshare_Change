# 2024_UK_Election_Labour_Voteshare_Change
A map showing the change in labour vote share from 2019 to 2024, labour made a gain of 211 seats for an increase
of just 1.7% in terms of vote share, we see that the increase in votes is mainly coming from the Scottish central
belt and various peri urban and rural seats in England. However labours losses have been concentrated in the seats
where they have won before like Manchester and Birmingham, their losses have even exceeded 40% in certain inner city 
areas, most probably due to the issue of palestine
